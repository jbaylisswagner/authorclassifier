['"weird"\n\nlet\'s discuss what this word means to us. to me it\'s one of the most positive words i know. i think i generally use it to replace "interesting" but after trying to convince a guy the other night that me calling him "weird" was a massive compliment, i realized i might be alone in this. i am completely attracted to things and people that are curiously bizarre. things i don\'t quite understand but that none the less, peak my interest. i think most people i know feel the same way but whenever i use the word with a big smile on my face, i get the oddest looks. i also tend to take it as a compliment when i\'m called "weird", even though i\'m sure it\'s often not meant that way :)\n\ngoogle image "weird" and this is the first thing that comes up. see how great it is?', 'F']

["i'm incredibly lonely, go figure.\n\nthe past year i've spent with you my one and only, fuck. you're still my one and only. so many empty promises left unkept, i don't know how to react.\n\ni'm so unstable, every other minute i'm biting my lip trying to hold back tears. everything doesn't seem to be getting better like everyone's promised.\n\ni'm spending christmas alone. i'm spending my mornings, afternoons, and nights alone. i crave being held, i crave being loved. i crave being the first priority, the first one thought about, the only one wanted.\nalways second best, seems that's all i will ever be.\n\ni drift through, day by day. trying to see a point in getting ready and standing up for the day. i don't see me having a future, it seems like there's some mental block keeping me from looking forward.\n\nwhy is it, that no matter who i get close to, there will always be someone better, and more worthy of they're time, energy, and thoughts? am i really just worth that little, that not one person would put me as first?\n\n'no, it's sarah. it's okay to shove her aside. she'll still be around. i can't say no to the other person, because if i do they'll walk away. but sarah, she'll never leave no matter what i do.'\n\npeople know i'll stick around no matter how i'm treated, everybody tells me that. they tell me they don't mean for me to end up as their punching bag, but that they need to let it out somehow, and that they know i'll be around regardless. and that i'm 'strong enough' to take it. it rips me apart. maybe i just care more than they do.\nmaybe i'm just not strong enough to walk away.", 'F']

["But listening only goes so far when you're trying to work out problems in you relationship. If you do not really understand where they are coming from, you might be creating more problems. When they are expressing themselves, you want to ask questions when appropriate in order to clarify what they are saying to you. Even if it seems uncomfortable at first, it's important that you make sure that you understand where they are at and how you might be able to help.", 'M']

["While you don't have to become legally separated to do this, taking time away from each other is one of the best ways to stop a marriage from becoming a divorced marriage. When you take time away from each other, you allow yourself to have a new perspective on the events that are happening. And this can allow you to see new solutions as well as new ideas for how to handle the problems that you may be having. Even if it's just a night or a few hours, taking time to step back from an issue can help it become easier to resolve.", 'M']

["for the past few days my brain has been turned off. i don't know why it is, but i go through spurts where i just turn off. maybe it's my brain's way of telling me it needs a break. my mind is very good at justifying breaks. no need to eat healthy ty, you just worked out. that's something my brain would say. it's a real bad influence on me as is my heart. they are always scheming of ways to make me look like a fool. i still like them though.", 'M']

['If NP Bayes had its way on this problem (or at least if the standard models I\'m familiar with had their way), they would memorize "talk" -> "talked" and "look" -> "looked" and so on because they\'re so familiar. Sure, it would still memorize the exceptions, but it would also memorize the really common "rule cases too... why? Because of course it could fall back to the parametric model, but these are so common that the standard models would really like to take advantage of the rich-get-richer phenomenon on things like DPs, thus saving themselves cost by memorizing a new "cluster" for each common word. (Okay, this is just my gut feeling about what such models would do, but I think it\'s at least defensible.) Yes, you could turn the DP "alpha" parameter down, but I guess I\'m just not convinced this would do the right thing. Maybe I should just implement such a beast but, well, this is a blog post, not a *ACL paper :P. Take as an alternative example the language modeling stuff. Basically what it says is "if you have enough data to substantiate memorizing a 5 gram, you should probably memorize a 5 gram." But why? If you could get the same effect with a 2 or 3 gram, why waste the storage/time?! I guess you could argue "your prior is wrong," which is probably true for most of these models. In which case I guess the question is "what prior does what I want?" I don\'t have a problem with rich get richer -- in fact, I think it\'s good in this case. I also don\'t have a problem with a logarithmic growth rate in the number of exceptions (though I\'d be curious how this holds up empirically -- in general, I\'m a big fan of checking if your prior makes sense; for instance, Figure 3 (p16) of my supervised clustering paper). I just don\'t like the notion of memorizing when you don\'t have to.', 'M']

["i might be moving back to california, maybe in the spring. i don't know. one minute i'm awful excited, the next it almost brings me to tears. i just got started back in school, i have friends there.. i have the potential of having a life.\ni just don't want to move again. but maybe it could be for the best.\ni'm so unbearably lonely, all the time. i sit at my house waiting for him to decide i'm worth picking up for a moment or two. i hate leaving my house in fear that i'll miss my chance when he actually wants me.\nevery time i leave to go anywhere, with the exception of school, i get extremely panicked and anxious. i don't know what to do with myself.\ni think it's pathetic, how i'm still the one cast aside. the one who's proved loyalty, honesty, devotion.. versus the one who used you 'just to see'. i know things are rough for you, i've been through it with you the whole time. but i can't handle this. i know you care, but i need it to be showed. i need to be taken care of sometimes.\n\nshe used you, used us.. the same way she does with everyone.. you won't ever see it, you won't ever realize. but it's the honest truth, everyones else knows.\ni mean, who else can go in.. destroy the perfect relationship between two people in love. just as an experiment? to see if it would work?\nthen a month later, decide. 'oh.. well i didn't actually feel that way. i just wanted to see. i thought so, but i was wrong.'\n\ni'm not even going to lie. it's awful what you and her have done to me. but being who i am, go figure i'd cast it aside. continue to be there for you BOTH. i'm so devoted, my life is spent doing what you want, or need. i take care of you constantly, and i don't even mind. i just wish you'd notice. i love you.\n\nsince i've met you, you've been the one thing that i completely put myself into. the one thing that i always think about, the one thing i always work to do for.\non my birthday at disneyland, i told everyone i felt sick with a migraine because you said you were upset, and everything with your dad that day. i didn't want to not be available for you.. i didn't want to not be able to be there for you. so i came home. on my birthday, just to be told that you were going to sleep.\ni bought you that $100 stuffed kangaroo so it would be shipped to your house before i left, just so you wouldn't be as lonely at night without me around.\nand every day.. i talk to you when you want to talk. i leave you alone when you don't. i'm at your disposal.\nand then, i do what i can for her as well. i take care of her when she's drunk as all hell, i take care of her emotions. i'm nice to her. when she back stabs me. im still there", 'F']

["Don't let anyone tell you what is right or what is best for your life. Do what is best for yourself and follow your heart. Stand tall and stand by your decisions, but always be prepared to admit your mistakes and admit when you were wrong.\n\nI have made a big decision in my life about my future. My family and friends have been very supportive of that decision, but there are some people that haven't. At first I let it get me down until I realized that I am the one that has to live my life and no one else can do it for me. So, I shouldn't let a few non-supporters choose the direction of my future. I have to do what is best for me. You should do the same.", 'F']

['Parents are probably the most interesting and the most annoying couples on this Earth. I think they act in such bizarre ways to get noticed by their aging offspring. I would gladly acknowledge my parents in a friendlier manner more often if they weren\'t so strange all the time. I don\'t know if they think because I\'m a teenager they need to be "cool" but I would prefer them not try at all becuase I\'d rather see their genuine selves.\nI\'m starting to realize that my mom and dad aren\'t just the people who have raised and taught me specific morals and lessons in life but they are also people who have thoughts and opinions. I would really love to hear what they think about certain topics but they just don\'t let this wall down so all I really get from them are lessons on what is good and what is bad. My parents and I have a good relationship, don\'t get me wrong, but I want to talk to them like they are just regular people.', 'F']
