["i'm incredibly lonely, go figure.\n\nthe past year i've spent with you my one and only, fuck. you're still my one and only. so many empty promises left unkept, i don't know how to react.\n\ni'm so unstable, every other minute i'm biting my lip trying to hold back tears. everything doesn't seem to be getting better like everyone's promised.\n\ni'm spending christmas alone. i'm spending my mornings, afternoons, and nights alone. i crave being held, i crave being loved. i crave being the first priority, the first one thought about, the only one wanted.\nalways second best, seems that's all i will ever be.\n\ni drift through, day by day. trying to see a point in getting ready and standing up for the day. i don't see me having a future, it seems like there's some mental block keeping me from looking forward.\n\nwhy is it, that no matter who i get close to, there will always be someone better, and more worthy of they're time, energy, and thoughts? am i really just worth that little, that not one person would put me as first?\n\n'no, it's sarah. it's okay to shove her aside. she'll still be around. i can't say no to the other person, because if i do they'll walk away. but sarah, she'll never leave no matter what i do.'\n\npeople know i'll stick around no matter how i'm treated, everybody tells me that. they tell me they don't mean for me to end up as their punching bag, but that they need to let it out somehow, and that they know i'll be around regardless. and that i'm 'strong enough' to take it. it rips me apart. maybe i just care more than they do.\nmaybe i'm just not strong enough to walk away.", 'F']

["for the past few days my brain has been turned off. i don't know why it is, but i go through spurts where i just turn off. maybe it's my brain's way of telling me it needs a break. my mind is very good at justifying breaks. no need to eat healthy ty, you just worked out. that's something my brain would say. it's a real bad influence on me as is my heart. they are always scheming of ways to make me look like a fool. i still like them though.", 'M']

["i might be moving back to california, maybe in the spring. i don't know. one minute i'm awful excited, the next it almost brings me to tears. i just got started back in school, i have friends there.. i have the potential of having a life.\ni just don't want to move again. but maybe it could be for the best.\ni'm so unbearably lonely, all the time. i sit at my house waiting for him to decide i'm worth picking up for a moment or two. i hate leaving my house in fear that i'll miss my chance when he actually wants me.\nevery time i leave to go anywhere, with the exception of school, i get extremely panicked and anxious. i don't know what to do with myself.\ni think it's pathetic, how i'm still the one cast aside. the one who's proved loyalty, honesty, devotion.. versus the one who used you 'just to see'. i know things are rough for you, i've been through it with you the whole time. but i can't handle this. i know you care, but i need it to be showed. i need to be taken care of sometimes.\n\nshe used you, used us.. the same way she does with everyone.. you won't ever see it, you won't ever realize. but it's the honest truth, everyones else knows.\ni mean, who else can go in.. destroy the perfect relationship between two people in love. just as an experiment? to see if it would work?\nthen a month later, decide. 'oh.. well i didn't actually feel that way. i just wanted to see. i thought so, but i was wrong.'\n\ni'm not even going to lie. it's awful what you and her have done to me. but being who i am, go figure i'd cast it aside. continue to be there for you BOTH. i'm so devoted, my life is spent doing what you want, or need. i take care of you constantly, and i don't even mind. i just wish you'd notice. i love you.\n\nsince i've met you, you've been the one thing that i completely put myself into. the one thing that i always think about, the one thing i always work to do for.\non my birthday at disneyland, i told everyone i felt sick with a migraine because you said you were upset, and everything with your dad that day. i didn't want to not be available for you.. i didn't want to not be able to be there for you. so i came home. on my birthday, just to be told that you were going to sleep.\ni bought you that $100 stuffed kangaroo so it would be shipped to your house before i left, just so you wouldn't be as lonely at night without me around.\nand every day.. i talk to you when you want to talk. i leave you alone when you don't. i'm at your disposal.\nand then, i do what i can for her as well. i take care of her when she's drunk as all hell, i take care of her emotions. i'm nice to her. when she back stabs me. im still there", 'F']

["Gwen has seen me through my worst; death of a loved one, broken heart, betrayal, you name it, she's been there. She's been one of the most sincere friends. She can tell me when I'm absolutely right, or when I'm absolutely wrong. She knows my mannerisms, she knows my personality in and out, she knows who I am and she still choses to stick around. That in my book, is dedication.\n\nOn the flip side, I know Gwen. I know when she's being way too quiet (usually means something is up), or when she's trying to hide something. I know when she's about to cry, I know when her laugh is sincere. I understand the pain she goes through, in one way or another, because her pain is my pain. I find that I want the best for her, even if it means that some day she might not be as easily accessible as she is now.\n\nI guess when it comes down to it, we both have a love and respect for each other. I cant wait to see the old us, sitting around in a kitchen filled with pictures of children and grandchildren, talking about how we were and how we are. I cant wait to know that every part of my life that I have been through, I have shared it with someone who understood me so completely without having to explain anything at all. I cant wait to be an old bum with my best friend Gwen.", 'F']

["The pain and the side effects will be there like uninvited guests.  They're hard to ignore, but I will do my best to do just that. So let's just remember all of our friends and loved ones who have had to deal with this dreadful disease, especially the ones we have lost, and enjoy all of the life and happiness that this special time brings. We must always remember that we are making memories that will help to carry us through the rough times to come.", 'M']

["You know life is life you can’t really chose where it takes you, god has a reason for everything that is the way I look at it. Sure you going to lose those you think you love and those you do, but if it wasn’t meant to be, there is nothing you can do but love, live and go on about your life. Sometime you get to the point when you have to just stop and think about all the positive things that have happened to you and stop thinking about the things in your life that you have fucked up, or things that have happened to you. My life has taken many many turn's some for the good some for the bad, but I am who I am from my past. I have many people that have been there for me throw everything and some that are just there to support me when I need someone to talk to, I am very thankful for those people and you know who you are. But I have to thank my dad for most of it, we have had are times like may may kids but he has never giving up on me even sometimes when he wanted to just drop kick me in the ass for some of the stupid shit I have done, but if it wasn’t for him I wouldn’t be the man I am today, if you know who i am u would know that I would do just about anything for those I care about. Some people abuse that to there advantage, but that’s there own fault. I want to thank everyone that has been there for me throw these ruff times and would do anything for you. But i am going to just say if your no longer in my life there is a reason why and you can just fuckin get over it!", 'M']
