['\ufeffI was standing on a ladder in the closet, cleaning out the shelves, when I noticed Gracie, our standard poodle puppy, throwing up in the corner.“Ethan, could you please help?” I asked my husband.He wiped up the mess with a few paper towels, but she threw up again, and then again.“I’m taking her to the vet,” he said, grabbing her, practically carrying her limp, dehydrated body out the door.He came back empty-handed. They wanted to hold her for observation. Four hours later, the only things left in my beloved 600-square-foot Upper West Side apartment were dust balls and a broom. I couldn’t believe I was moving away after 15 years; it was longer than I’d ever lived anywhere else. The place had history. I didn’t want to leave, but Ethan and I had just gotten married, and I was almost 40 years old, pregnant with our first child. The apartment was clearly too small for our growing family. But I still had to get out fast before I started crying.I called to check up on Gracie as we drove over the Queensboro Bridge to Long Island City, where our new, bigger apartment awaited us.“We think she might have an obstruction is her small intestines. We’re going to have to keep her overnight,” the vet said.I caught my breath.“It’s going to be O.K.,” Ethan said, rubbing the top of my hand.After the movers had gone, and the “couch doctors” had successfully broken our couch to get it inside, Ethan and I sat in our new kitchen, eating pizza, missing Gracie at our knees.The next morning, the streets were covered in snow, inches and inches of white snow, the kind that creates an unusual hush for New York City. The phone rang. It was the vet. “You need to bring Gracie to the emergency clinic on 55th. She needs an operation and we don’t have anyone here who can do it. You have to pick her up within the hour.”My body started to shake and I held my stomach protectively. I was only nine weeks along, but we’d heard the heartbeat, and I didn’t want the baby to know how upset I was. “If we still lived on the Upper West Side we could just cross the street and get her,” I said to Ethan, wishing we could have afforded a two-bedroom in my old building. Now we had to walk seven blocks to the E train and transfer to the 2.When we arrived, Gracie hobbled over to us with a catheter taped to her front right leg. Her tail was wagging, but she didn’t have the energy to jump up on us. We rushed her outside and tried to hail a cab. The first driver took one look at her and kept driving. The second one didn’t see her until we had all slid into  the back seat.“Get out,” he screamed. “No dogs!”“But she needs surgery!” I screamed back.“No dogs!”Then I lost it. I started crying, cursing, my eyeballs bulging, yelling at this man with no heart.Ethan carried Gracie out of the car and stood on the corner, waiting for someone who would take us. I kept crying even after a taxi picked us up, was still sobbing by the time we met with the new vet.“We can’t be sure that there is something in her small intestines,” he told us. “But if you look here, you’ll see this dark shadow is not normal.” He pointed at the scan on the screen. “It’s your call, though.”“If there is something, could she get sepsis and die?” I asked, finally calm enough to speak.“Yes,” he said.Ethan and I went off to discuss what we should do. It was the first real decision we’d ever had to make as a married couple. To spend $4,000 we didn’t have. And to put our dog through something that she might not need.“This is why it’s scary to love anything,” Ethan said.I hugged him, and then we decided yes, we would do it.We left Gracie and took the two trains back to our box-filled apartment with a washer and dryer, two bedrooms and no dog.A few hours later, the doctor called to tell us there was nothing in there.Over the next five days I had to ice Gracie’s belly, lined with 30 staples, every four hours, give her painkillers and antibiotics, and make sure she wasn’t developing a post-op infection. Teaching online classes from home made it easy for me to take care of her. Ethan’s work had gotten crazy and he wasn’t getting home until 2 a.m. It was just me and Gracie, lying on the floor, out of place in this new space, both feeling our bodies change.Two weeks after the move, I tied Gracie’s plastic cone to her neck and left her in the crate so I could go to my 11-week doctor visit.“Is spotting normal?” I asked.“Let’s take a look,” the gynecologist said.Our faces both turned to the monitor, seeing the same thing at the same time: a dark blob, no flickering, no life. I had lost the baby.“You did nothing wrong,” she said.But I had. I had moved. I had yelled at that cabdriver. We had given our puppy unnecessary surgery.Ethan left work to meet me. We held each other on the couch, cried and called our parents, taking back our good news.I wanted to shut my eyes and go back home, to my real home, on West 72nd Street, back to the refuge that had gotten me through 15 years of breakups and bouts of depression and changes I couldn’t control.That night, Gracie put her chin in my lap and looked up at me. She couldn’t give me medicine or make my night sweats go away, but she wagged her tail and forced me outside to explore our new streets of Long Island City.When the weather got warmer, Ethan and I took her to the dog park two blocks away and watched her jump high in the air trying to catch the ball. She was O.K. Turning to Ethan, I was starting to feel O.K. too. This was my family, and it helped to know that whenever Gracie bounded up the stairs after playing, she had no clue why the back bedroom, the reason we moved in the first place, was empty.', 'F']

['\ufeffI’ve been feeling freshly conscious of an aspect of being human that’s so constant and fundamental it seems weird to me that it isn’t a subject of everyday conversation. It’s simply this: that at the background of all my activities and interactions, behind all the containers I pour myself into from moment to moment, is my awareness of the boundless ocean of awareness itself.I feel it as an amoeba-like latency, an unruly sea of infinite possibility, lurking in the back room — exciting, ominous, darkly beckoning. It conjures up the image Jonathan Franzen uses in his novel “The Corrections” of an impending thunderstorm: “big spiders in a little jar.” Only the jar in this case is infinitely vast, the spiders correspondingly enormous. They huddle in the back room, waiting for the lid to come off. Waiting to leak or seep or sneak through some hidden cat-door and flood the room I live in.\n   \n With it is the chronic background anxiety that if I don’t pour myself into this or that (read my book, clean the house, or at the very least think a bunch of thoughts), I’ll fall into this ocean of shapelessness and lose all sense of definition. I’ll be ejected from the safe confines of my predictable foreground world, where all the familiar experiences live: the sensations and tastes and textures that confirm my sense of who I am.I live in this foreground world. I depend on it for my orientation, my ability to navigate through a day. It supports my belief that I am a separate, cohesive individual.But I’m haunted by the knowledge that foreground can’t exist without background, any more than weather can exist without sky. The existence of the one necessarily implies the existence of the other. Despite this, I restrict my attention to the foreground. I keep my settings on “busy.”Still, I’m haunted by implications. Something whispers that I’m only living half a life. And the half I’m living is coming way too fast. I’m on the down escalator  trying to run up, but no matter how fast I run, I stay in the same spot — always a little agitated, a little lost, a little hungry.What to do? The logical solution would be to check out the background. Be adventurous, explore this vastness that breathes so continually down my neck.Easily said. Unhappily, when I do stray, accidentally or intentionally, into this formless background, I recall all too quickly what the foreground commotion is doing for me.It’s protecting me from the intolerable experience of being a personality: a rabid consumer of ego-supplies with a curiously cruel capacity for self-awareness. A capacity that leads perversely to the realization that despite my hard-won knowledge that all my yearnings are ultimately doomed, still there will never be an end to yearning.It’s protecting me from my meanness, my ugliness, my judgments about my looks and my smarts, my uncertainty about my lovability and my capability.It’s protecting me from tasting the certain knowledge that I’m not built to last, that no matter what intimations I may have of after-states, I still face an irrevocable loss when I die. Everything as I know it, gone.It’s protecting me from the secrets I keep even from myself.It’s protecting me from the unbearable taste of my separateness, my chronic disconnection from life, within and without. It’s creating the wall of white noise that distracts me from my deep sense of meaninglessness, my feeling of being locked in and locked out at the same time — trapped on the surface of my life, nose against the glass, dimly aware that somewhere a feast is going on. Somewhere I’m not.Extreme irony, given that this foreground commotion is also the cause of my disconnection.What could be crazier? My mind incessantly constructing a wall of white noise to distract me from the dreariness of its incessant constructions. Stale solutions continually reproducing the same stale problems, locking me in to a life in the shallows. A life that had one school of existentialists believing that suicide was the logical “cure” for the human condition.I look in vain for a consolation prize. What do I get for taking these pains, for subjecting myself to a glimpse of the background?Most of the time, a convincing argument for staying in the foreground. The whispered suggestion that it’s probably best to just keep up the clatter. And the implicit judgment that I’m worse than pathetic if I can’t take the heat. After all, everyone else (mostly) seems to be staying alive.  I circle my jar of spiders…At some point it occurs to me that circling my jar is quite possibly the worst of it. It’s so neither here nor there. I give up. Out of sheer exhaustion, I take off the lid and slide in. What else is there to do? I tell them to go ahead, eat me alive.They’re only too happy to oblige. The white noise gradually subsides and they set to work, sucking the sweet, juicy marrow of hope from the bones of all my constructions.(Somewhere a feast is going on…)One after another the buildings collapse, until all hope is gone and I’m alone in the rubble.I know this place. It’s flat and empty and dead. There’s nowhere left to run and nothing left to hide. After a long while, I notice the quiet: bleak, but oddly relaxing. No straining, nothing to hold up. There seems to be something left of me as well, though I’d be hard pressed to give it a name.It finally dawns on me that I’ve made it through the switcheroo. Background has become foreground. I’m now the thing I was running from — the formless ocean of awareness itself.My sense of an impending thunderstorm has dissolved. It was apparently a feature of life on the run. Now the spiders are all over there, where the foreground used to be. They look small and hectic from here, more like ants. Noisily milling about.Me, I’m the emptiness inside the jar, though the jar itself has vanished. I’m spacious and peaceful and vast.I like this place. As always, I resolve to remember what a relief this is.I vow to bring myself to the feast more often.As usual, I forget and get trapped outside again. Circling the jar.', 'F']

['\ufeffAnxiety: We worry. A gallery of contributors count the ways.Tags:Anxiety, motherhood, post-partum anxietyWhen Clara, my daughter, turned four months old, my husband Danny and I celebrated the end of the “fourth trimester.”  From here, the books had said, things would get easier. I began to look forward to fitting into old clothes, my C-section incision no longer hurting, attending parties, readings and concerts. I’d already gone back to my day job tutoring teenagers eight weeks before (freelance artists don’t get maternity leave), but I missed my real work— writing.  Now, the new, post-baby version of my beloved internal life could begin.  I’d write and read, while producing milk and cuddling my girl.But something was wrong. I was so tired. Commuting on the subway rendered me nauseated and dizzy.  The effort of bumping Clara down my Brooklyn stoop for a stroll in the winter sunshine was insurmountable.  How would I make it around the block without something terrible happening?  When my mom friends held our first night-out-without-babies, I was too nervous to show up.  On the street, faces grimaced and swelled into malevolence.  Car alarms, sirens and unexpected footfalls made me jump.I pushed through my worry and sleep deprivation by writing.  For a long month, I worked on an essay for an anthology about Madonna and celebrity baby obsession.  But Clara would cry as soon as I opened my computer.  I’d pop her in her swing (which our baby book called a “mechanical mommy”), she’d conk back out and I’d frantically type until she screamed again.  The sound of the swing became the rhythm of the essay; I became the topic.  Had Madonna ever had to time her dance rehearsals between naps and pumping? People magazine never mentioned it.At night, when Clara woke to nurse in her bassinet beside me, we’d both always fallen easily back to sleep, but now I lay awake, heart thumping, fearful heat rippling my skin.  Danny is a chronic insomniac, but now I was the one buzzing, waking him to ask what I should do to fall asleep.  This didn’t feel right, but I’d never had a baby before.  Did every new mother lay awake alone in the dark?  After a few weeks, Danny went out of town for two nights.  I’d been looking forward to my first solo with the baby, proving I didn’t need my husband so much, that I wasn’t scared to be left with my child.I don’t know how much I slept the first night he was gone.  After reading all of  “Bridget Jones’ Diary,” I closed my eyes and counted down from 100 until I nodded off.  Clara must have sensed my disturbance because she woke more than ever.The next day, I was so tired I felt sick. I needed another adult body in the house, but all my friends either had new babies, taxing jobs, or weren’t the types to burden with my vulnerability.  Putting aside any semblance of pride, I called a friend I hadn’t spoken to in years, begging her to come sleep on my couch.  When she arrived, I was so relieved I started shaking as hard as I had when my epidural hit.The next day, my parents arrived from Philadelphia.  “You’re just a little freaked out, honey,” my dad said.  “You have what you always wanted, but you’ve been through hell.”  When Danny got home a few hours later, we hoped the worst was over.  But my sleep worsened, my fears mounted and my father’s words looped through my head.Danny and I had been through hell.  In May 2009, a year and a half before Clara’s birth, I was overjoyed to see a second line on a home pregnancy test for the first time. Eight weeks in, at my ob-gyn’s office I asked, “Can we see a heartbeat yet?”  The doctor paused.  “I’m sorry,” she said.I turned 35 the day after she declared my pregnancy finished, and we spent the rest of the summer watching the “The Wire,” pausing to cry or fight.  I tested positive again in October, but by Thanksgiving…Between miscarriages, I went to acupuncture, worked out, and set myself a daily writing word count.  It helped, but what I yearned for (besides a baby) was to talk about my body and mind, to find comfort in the verbalization of this nightmare.  I’ve spent much of my adult life on the therapeutic couch, but I refused to see a professional.  Instead, I wanted my friends and family to make me feel better.People don’t like to talk about death, and miscarriage is a confusing version of mortality.  It’s sex and blood, and not in the easy horror movie sense.  Everyone apologetically responded with the same platitudes: once you have a baby, you won’t remember.  Statistics say you’ll have a healthy child soon. Reduce your stress.When I got pregnant for the third time, in February 2010, we rationed our hope.  After seeing not only a heartbeat, but also ultrasounds of feet and hands, and then our daughter’s brain and face, we relaxed a little.Until I began bleeding.  On the way to the emergency room, I announced that if this one didn’t stick, we’d take a trip and get a dog.  Thankfully, Clara (we’d known her name since the first pregnancy) was still perfect, my bleeding benign.  At the beginning of my third trimester, I was diagnosed with gestational diabetes, a pregnancy complication so common as to be almost banal — except I had to prick my finger with a mechanized lancet five times a day, swear off ice cream, fruit and lemonade during the hottest summer in New York history, and surrender my plan for a natural delivery.Clara was a healthy seven pounds at birth.  Still, my dutiful single slice of seven-grain bread a day, my weekly ultrasounds and non-stress tests, didn’t prevent 36 hours of labor, followed by a C-section.  When we brought Clara home, I’d been in some version of pregnancy or recovery from pregnancy for a year and a half.  I’ll never know how that affected me hormonally.  It certainly set me at odds with my body.  A few weeks after Clara’s birth, bedridden and weepy, I took an online assessment test for postpartum depression, but didn’t qualify; I wasn’t sad enough.  As I got to know Clara, I forgot how terrified I’d been.Now the worry was back.  On the night I fell asleep at 1:30, waking an hour later as if for the day, I called the doctor.  Actually, three: my ob-gyn, my new mommy cohort who happens to be a psychiatrist, and my pediatrician aunt.  You need medicine and help, they said.My shrink friend referred me to a psychiatrist who diagnosed me with postpartum anxiety.  I filled his prescriptions for anxiety and insomnia meds, as well as an antidepressant.  My parents came back into town to help, offering cash so we could hire more babysitters.  I found a wonderful therapist who specializes in postpartum issues.  We moved Clara out of our bedroom, and into Danny’s home office.  He bedded down on the couch and took the night feeds for months so I could have unbroken rest.For weeks, I hovered between panic attacks, waiting for the anti-depressants to kick in.  Postpartum anxiety often includes “intrusive thoughts” of harm coming to the baby, but I knew she was thriving; I was worried about myself.  Leaving the house for the day, I’d run home after a few blocks, weeping and apologizing to Danny and Clara, gulping down a pill.  Then I’d go to bed and cry more, until the medicine put me to sleep.Then there was breastfeeding.  Clara was so little, and I wasn’t willing to give up nursing.  When I took an anti-anxiety pill, I couldn’t feed her for four hours.  Watching her scrunch up her face and scream, I wondered if I was the worst mother in the world.Eventually, the antidepressants took effect and I did get better.  These days, I often write in a local coffee shop at the same time as a new mom’s group.  The babies are tiny, the moms’ bodies are still soft and swollen.  I watch them select pastries, listen to them talk too loud, and with too much detail.  They’re exchanging freshman year confidences, telling their most basic stories along with anecdotes about naps.  I want to tell them it might get worse before it gets better, but they’re enjoying their cappuccinos and chocolate croissants.I’ve come to believe that our obsession with birth acts as a scrim for our lack of attention to what happens after.  More than one in 10  women experience a postpartum mood disorder, but there’s no DSM category for them, so my psychiatrist had to list “major anxiety” as my insurance diagnosis.  My post-labor ob-gyn appointment took place before my symptoms manifested, and while my excellent, progressive doctor warned me that postpartum depression could appear any time in the first year, she never mentioned insomnia or anxiety as separate issues.  Nor did the gestational diabetes specialists who saw me every week for months when I was pregnant.  I discovered that gestational diabetes and miscarriage are risk factors for postpartum the way I found most of my information – on the Internet.A year past my diagnosis, I haven’t had a panic attack in months, though a particularly bad night of sleep or too much work can still make me worry that a “normal” mother wouldn’t need this much childcare or protein, or so many naps.  Acknowledging how my condition must have affected my loved ones shuts me down a little, and I will always grieve that I don’t know who I am as a mother without this.  That is parenthood: changes and mistakes, the integration of fear and love.A few days ago, Clara said “home” for the first time.  I’m not taking the symbolism of that too seriously.', 'F']

['\ufeff    Olivia Judson on the influence of science and biology on modern life.   Tags: breast milk, Cancer, circadian rhythm, light, Obesity, Sleep    Here’s my prediction for the Next Big Thing in health care: chronotherapy, or therapy by the clock.  Yes, in the future, your medicines, your operations, your mealtimes and when you step onto the treadmill or the badminton court — all will be overseen by your personal chronoconsultant.  It’s been known for ages that our bodies have daily, or “circadian,” rhythms.  Body temperature is lower in the morning than it is in the afternoon.  Blood pressure is low during the night, and rises just before you wake.  Muscles are stronger in the afternoon than they are in the morning, and you may have greater dexterity then, too.  Badminton players tend to serve more accurately in the afternoon, for example. But now it’s clear that the body clock is in charge of many other, more subtle processes as well.  The content of human breast milk changes during the day.  Evening milk is full of compounds that make a baby sleepy; morning milk isn’t.  The liver, too, has a strong daily rhythm: many of its activities shut down during the night.  Levels of several hormones, including melatonin (involved in sleep) and ghrelin (involved in appetite), rise at night.  Testosterone, in contrast, is highest in the morning and lowest in the late afternoon.  Cholesterol is made more rapidly at night.  Even cancers have a rhythm: breast cancers, for instance, grow faster during the day.\n  \n The implications of all this are huge.  Living against your body clock — as so many of us do — can affect your health and well-being in myriad ways.  Some of these are trivial: unless you’re professional (or super-competitive), it probably doesn’t matter if your badminton serve is a little off in your morning games. Besides, your opponent’s will be, too.  (It may, however, be better for your heart if you play in the afternoon.)   But living against the clock can also lead to major health problems. Obesity, breast cancer and certain kinds of mental illness are all associated with circadian disruption.   Disruption can be a consequence of shiftwork or jetlag — or of not spending enough time sleeping, or in the dark.  Darkness is important because even a brief exposure to light during sleep-time can be enough to reduce melatonin levels and reset the body clock.  Exposure to light in the night has been linked to breast cancer; consistent with this, women who are totally blind have a lower incidence of breast cancer than those who can see even a little bit. Badly timed light isn’t the only troublemaker.  Eating at the wrong moments — like the middle of the night — makes it harder for the body to process food and leads to weight gain.  A recent experiment shows this nicely.  Two groups of mice were fed identical diets but on different schedules: one group was allowed to eat only during normal waking hours, while the other was restricted to eating during normal sleeping hours.  After six weeks, the mice allowed to eat only during sleep-time were significantly fatter than the wake-time eaters — a result that may help explain why obesity is so common among shift-workers who, because of their jobs, are forced to eat against their clocks. In fact, sleep itself has been implicated in obesity: not sleeping enough is associated with getting fat.  (Which suggests the sleep diet: stack those Zs and see the pounds melt away!)  More worrying: obesity may actually interfere with the clock mechanism.  In mice, the genes involved in regulating the body clock function differently in obese animals as compared to thin ones: the clocks of obese animals are less rhythmic.  Perhaps, then, one way to treat (or prevent) obesity would be to impose a strong circadian rhythm on mealtimes and bedtimes.   To my knowledge, chronotherapy has not yet been tried for obesity; but it has, with great success, been used in psychiatry.  Several mental disorders, including bipolar disorder, can be rapidly ameliorated by a resetting of the body clock.  Indeed, it’s been argued that manipulating the body clock affects the same parts of the brain as antidepressant drugs — but that chronotherapy works faster and with fewer side effects. Even conventional medicines work better when the body clock is taken into account.  For example, evidence suggests that some statins — drugs that help people reduce their cholesterol levels — are more effective when taken before bedtime.  Several of the drugs used in chemotherapy also have a “best” time of day: give the drug at the right moment, and you can take a smaller dosage, get a greater benefit and have a lower risk of unpleasant side effects.  Sounds good.  But don’t forget: regular good sleep in a nice dark room can inhibit tumors, and may thus help you avoid chemo in the first place. Much more, no doubt, remains to be discovered, and it may, in fact, be a while before a chronotherapist opens an office near you.  (That’s often the nature of the Next Big Thing — you see it on the horizon ages before it arrives.) But while we’re waiting for medicine by the hourglass, there are still steps that can be taken.  I don’t know about you, but I’m going to darken my bedroom, cancel the midnight feasts and put sleep at the top of my list of things to do.  It’s about time. The circadian rhythm of body temperature is well known — and easy to verify for oneself.  For the circadian rhythm of blood pressure, see Smolensky, M. H. et al.  2007.  “Role of sleep-wake cycle on blood pressure circadian rhythms and hypertension.” Sleep Medicine 8: 668-680.

L. et al.  2009.  “The possible role of human milk nucleotides as sleep inducers.”  Nutritional Neuroscience 12: 2-8; and Cubero, J. et al.  2005.  “The circadian rhythm of tryptophan in breast milk affects the rhythms of 6-sulfatoxymelatonin and sleep in newborn.” Neuroendocrinology Letters 26: 657-661.  For the liver having a strong circadian rhythm, see Reddy, A. B. et al.  2006.  “Circadian orchestration of the hepatic proteome.” Current Biology 16: 1107-1115.  The behavior of melatonin is well-known; but for a good overview of how it works, see Blask, D. E. 2008.  “Melatonin, sleep disturbance and cancer risk.” Sleep Medicine Reviews 13: 257-264.  This paper also reviews the association between cancers and shift-work, and between cancers and exposure to light at night.  The author also advocates spending time sleeping and in total darkness as a possible anti-cancer therapy. For ghrelin being higher at night, see Yildiz, B. O. et al.  2004.  “Alterations in the dynamics of circulating ghrelin, adiponectin, and leptin in human obesity.”  Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA 101: 10434-10439.

A. et al.  2007.  “The influence of sleep and sleep loss upon food intake and metabolism.”  Nutrition Research Reviews 20: 195-212; also see this paper for a review of the circadian rhythm of cholesterol synthesis.  These authors argue for more sleep as one way to help prevent obesity.   For obesity interfering with the body clock in mice, see Kaneko, K. et al.  2009.  “Obesity alters circadian expressions of molecular clock genes in the brainstem.” Brain Research 1263: 58-68.  A google search on “chrononutrition” reveals a French diet that purports to work by timing food consumption; however, I was unable to find any papers about it in the standard scientific databases, so I couldn’t assess how well it works.

['\ufeff~~~When the world ends, you and the handful of other survivors are going to fight each other for what’s left. There’s going to be a little food and potable water, and a bit of inhabitable space. Maybe people speak the same language, or maybe they don’t, but words don’t matter anymore. It matters who is lucky and cunning and ambitious and strong. People eat things that you, here and now, would never dream of touching. Ultimately it doesn’t matter because the world is about to end, but if nothing else, you have a strong survival instinct. This is why, when you see something that appears to be edible, you don’t know whether to starve to death or risk being poisoned. They’re two means to the same end.A few months of this obsessive compulsive thinking has you wearing the J.C. Penney pants you wore in ninth grade. You’re tiny. Everyone tells you that you look skinny and you don’t know how to respond. Thank you seems inappropriate because it’s not a compliment, but what else are you supposed to say? There’s poison in my food and we’re all dying?\n  \n The doctor keeps telling you that starvation can stop your heart. This fascinates you. It’s not that you want to die. If you wanted to die you’d fill your stomach with high fructose corn syrup and blue dye. You don’t want to die.But to disappear would feel so nice. At night you lie in bed and touch the empty space between each rib. You feel how far under your ribcage your hand goes. You imagine reaching all the way in. Your fingers clasp around your heart. Your arm disappears inside of you, and then your shoulder and your head. Your body sucks up your body black-hole-style. Then this thought starts to disturb you, but now you can’t get it out of your head and it sticks there like it’s the only image you’ve ever seen in your life.You begin to feel angry with everyone else, because it’s easier to feel angry than to feel sad. You don’t express these emotions, but you think about them constantly. You begin to resent your Jewish upbringing. Why are the Torah’s laws piety and yours insanity? One set of rules says chicken and cheese can’t go on the same plate and another set forbids any food from touching a blue plate. The rabbis debate whether giraffe is kosher, and you debate whether it’s O.K. to eat two foods of the same color in one day. That kosher is dedication; yours is absurdity. And so you feel angry, but you know that’s not productive.Waiting to feel better yields different results than you had expected. You aren’t sure what you expected, actually. You still can’t stop thinking about your body digesting itself through your ribcage and you can’t remember the last time you ate sauce. But you realize that there is so much healing to be done, and no more. Tomorrow you will still be skinny. The next day you will still be obsessive. The day after that you will still be compulsive. No amount of therapy or medicine or patience is going to change that, but somehow you will find a way to coexist with your neuroses.', 'F']

['\ufeff Diane Ackerman on the natural world, the world of human endeavor and connections between the two.Tags:love, marriage, stressA RELATIVELY new field, called interpersonal neurobiology, draws its vigor from one of the great discoveries of our era: that the brain is constantly rewiring itself based on daily life. In the end, what we pay the most attention to defines us. How you choose to spend the irreplaceable hours of your life literally transforms you.All relationships change the brain — but most important are the intimate bonds that foster or fail us, altering the delicate circuits that shape memories, emotions and that ultimate souvenir, the self.Every great love affair begins with a scream. At birth, the brain starts blazing new neural pathways based on its odyssey in an alien world. An infant is steeped in bright, buzzing, bristling sensations, raw emotions and the curious feelings they unleash, weird objects, a flux of faces, shadowy images and dreams — but most of all a powerfully magnetic primary caregiver whose wizardry astounds.Brain scans show synchrony between the brains of mother and child; but what they can’t show is the internal bond that belongs to neither alone, a fusion in which the self feels so permeable it doesn’t matter whose body is whose. Wordlessly, relying on the heart’s semaphores, the mother says all an infant needs to hear, communicating through eyes, face and voice. Thanks to advances in neuroimaging, we now have evidence that a baby’s first attachments imprint its brain. The patterns of a lifetime’s behaviors, thoughts, self-regard and choice of sweethearts all begin in this crucible.We used to think this was the end of the story: first heredity, then the brain’s engraving mental maps in childhood, after which you’re pretty much stuck with the final blueprint.But as a wealth of imaging studies highlight, the neural alchemy continues throughout life as we mature and forge friendships, dabble in affairs, succumb to romantic love, choose a soul mate. The body remembers how that oneness with Mother felt, and longs for its adult equivalent.  As the most social apes, we inhabit a mirror-world in which every important relationship, whether with spouse, friend or child, shapes the brain, which in turn shapes our relationships. Daniel J. Siegel and Allan N. Schore, colleagues at the University of California, Los Angeles, recently discussed groundbreaking work in the field at a conference on the school’s campus. It’s not that caregiving changes genes; it influences how the genes express themselves as the child grows. Dr. Siegel, a neuropsychiatrist, refers to the indelible sense of “feeling felt” that we learn as infants and seek in romantic love, a reciprocity that remodels the brain’s architecture and functions.Does it also promote physical well-being? “Scientific studies of longevity, medical and mental health, happiness and even wisdom,” Dr. Siegel says, “point to supportive relationships as the most robust predictor of these positive attributes in our lives across the life span.”The supportive part is crucial. Loving relationships alter the brain the most significantly.Just consider how much learning happens when you choose a mate. Along with thrilling dependency comes glimpsing the world through another’s eyes; forsaking some habits and adopting others (good or bad); tasting new ideas, rituals, foods or landscapes; a slew of added friends and family; a tapestry of physical intimacy and affection; and many other catalysts, including a tornadic blast of attraction and attachment hormones — all of which revamp the brain.When two people become a couple, the brain extends its idea of self to include the other; instead of the slender pronoun “I,” a plural self emerges who can borrow some of the other’s assets and strengths. The brain knows who we are. The immune system knows who we’re not, and it stores pieces of invaders as memory aids. Through lovemaking, or when we pass along a flu or a cold sore, we trade bits of identity with loved ones, and in time we become a sort of chimera. We don’t just get under a mate’s skin, we absorb him or her.Love is the best school, but the tuition is high and the homework can be painful. As imaging studies by the U.C.L.A. neuroscientist Naomi Eisenberger show, the same areas of the brain that register physical pain are active when someone feels socially rejected. That’s why being spurned by a lover hurts all over the body, but in no place you can point to. Or rather, you’d need to point to the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex in the brain, the front of a collar wrapped around the corpus callosum, the bundle of nerve fibers zinging messages between the hemispheres that register both rejection and physical assault.Whether they speak Armenian or Mandarin, people around the world use the same images of physical pain to describe a broken heart, which they perceive as crushing and crippling. It’s not just a metaphor for an emotional punch. Social pain can trigger the same sort of distress as a stomachache or a broken bone.But a loving touch is enough to change everything. James Coan, a neuroscientist at the University of Virginia, conducted experiments in 2006 in which he gave an electric shock to the ankles of women in happy, committed relationships. Tests registered their anxiety before, and pain level during, the shocks.Then they were shocked again, this time holding their loving partner’s hand. The same level of electricity produced a significantly lower neural response throughout the brain. In troubled relationships, this protective effect didn’t occur. If you’re in a healthy relationship, holding your partner’s hand is enough to subdue your blood pressure, ease your response to stress, improve your health and soften physical pain. We alter one another’s physiology and neural functions.However, it’s not all sub rosa. One can decide to be a more attentive and compassionate partner, mindful of the other’s motives, hurts and longings. Breaking old habits isn’t easy, since habits are deeply ingrained neural shortcuts, a way of slurring over details without having to dwell on them. Couples often choose to rewire their brains on purpose, sometimes with a therapist’s help, to ease conflicts and strengthen their at-one-ness.While they were both in the psychology department of Stony Brook University, Bianca Acevedo and Arthur Aron scanned the brains of long-married couples who described themselves as still “madly in love.” Staring at a picture of a spouse lit up their reward centers as expected; the same happened with those newly in love (and also with cocaine users). But, in contrast to new sweethearts and cocaine addicts, long-married couples displayed calm in sites associated with fear and anxiety. Also, in the opiate-rich sites linked to pleasure and pain relief, and those affiliated with maternal love, the home fires glowed brightly.A happy marriage relieves stress and makes one feel as safe as an adored baby. Small wonder “Baby” is a favorite adult endearment. Not that romantic love is an exact copy of the infant bond. One needn’t consciously regard a lover as momlike to profit from the parallels. The body remembers, the brain recycles and restages.So how does this play out beyond the lab? I saw the healing process up close after my 74-year-old husband, who is also a writer, suffered a left-hemisphere stroke that wiped out a lifetime of language. All he could utter was “mem.” Mourning the loss of our duet of decades, I began exploring new ways to communicate, through caring gestures, pantomime, facial expressions, humor, play, empathy and tons of affection — the brain’s epitome of a safe attachment. That, plus the admittedly eccentric home schooling I provided, and his diligent practice, helped rewire his brain to a startling degree, and in time we were able to talk again, he returned to writing books, and even his vision improved. The brain changes with experience throughout our lives; it’s in loving relationships of all sorts — partners, children, close friends — that brain and body really thrive.During idylls of safety, when your brain knows you’re with someone you can trust, it needn’t waste precious resources coping with stressors or menace. Instead it may spend its lifeblood learning new things or fine-tuning the process of healing. Its doors of perception swing wide open. The flip side is that, given how vulnerable one then is, love lessons — sweet or villainous — can make a deep impression. Wedded hearts change everything, even the brain.', 'F']

['\ufeffYour chair is your enemy.It doesn’t matter if you go running every morning, or you’re a regular at the gym.  If you spend most of the rest of the day sitting — in your car, your office chair, on your sofa at home — you are putting yourself at increased risk of obesity, diabetes, heart disease, a variety of cancers and an early death.  In other words, irrespective of whether you exercise vigorously, sitting for long periods is bad for you.That, at least, is the conclusion of several recent studies.  Indeed, if you consider only healthy people who exercise regularly, those who sit the most during the rest of the day have larger waists and worse profiles of blood pressure and blood sugar than those who sit less.  Among people who sit in front of the television for more than three hours each day, those who exercise are as fat as those who don’t: sitting a lot appears to offset some of the benefits of jogging a lot.So what’s wrong with sitting?\n  \n The answer seems to have two parts.  The first is that sitting is one of the most passive things you can do.  You burn more energy by chewing gum or fidgeting than you do sitting still in a chair. Compared to sitting, standing in one place is hard work.  To stand, you have to tense your leg muscles, and engage the muscles of your back and shoulders; while standing, you often shift from leg to leg.  All of this burns energy.For many people, weight gain is a matter of slow creep — two pounds this year, three pounds next year.  You can gain this much if, each day, you eat just 30 calories more than you burn.  Thirty calories is hardly anything — it’s a couple of mouthfuls of banana, or a few potato chips.  Thus, a little more time on your feet today and tomorrow can easily make the difference between remaining lean and getting fat.You may think you have no choice about how much you sit.  But this isn’t true.  Suppose you sleep for eight hours each day, and exercise for one.  That still leaves 15 hours of activities.  Even if you exercise, most of the energy you burn will be burnt during these 15 hours, so weight gain is often the cumulative effect of a series of small decisions: Do you take the stairs or the elevator?  Do you e-mail your colleague down the hall, or get up and go and see her?  When you get home, do you potter about in the garden or sit in front of the television?  Do you walk to the corner store, or drive?Just to underscore the point that you do have a choice: a study of junior doctors doing the same job, the same week, on identical wards found that some individuals walked four times farther than others at work each day.  (No one in the study was overweight; but the “long-distance” doctors were thinner than the “short-distance” doctors.)So part of the problem with sitting a lot is that you don’t use as much energy as those who spend more time on their feet.  This makes it easier to gain weight, and makes you more prone to the health problems that fatness often brings.But it looks as though there’s a more sinister aspect to sitting, too.  Several strands of evidence suggest that there’s a “physiology of inactivity”: that when you spend long periods sitting, your body actually does things that are bad for you.As an example, consider lipoprotein lipase.  This is a molecule that plays a central role in how the body processes fats; it’s produced by many tissues, including muscles.  Low levels of lipoprotein lipase are associated with a variety of health problems, including heart disease.  Studies in rats show that leg muscles only produce this molecule when they are actively being flexed (for example, when the animal is standing up and ambling about).  The implication is that when you sit, a crucial part of your metabolism slows down.Nor is lipoprotein lipase the only molecule affected by muscular inactivity.  Actively contracting muscles produce a whole suite of substances that have a beneficial effect on how the body uses and stores sugars and fats.Which might explain the following result.  Men who normally walk a lot (about 10,000 steps per day, as measured by a pedometer) were asked to cut back (to about 1,350 steps per day) for two weeks, by using elevators instead of stairs, driving to work instead of walking and so on.  By the end of the two weeks, all of them had became worse at metabolizing sugars and fats.  Their distribution of body fat had also altered — they had become fatter around the middle.  Such changes are among the first steps on the road to diabetes.Conversely, a study of people who sit for many hours found that those who took frequent small breaks — standing up to stretch or walk down the corridor — had smaller waists and better profiles for sugar and fat metabolism than those who did their sitting in long, uninterrupted chunks.Some people have advanced radical solutions to the sitting syndrome: replace your sit-down desk with a stand-up desk, and equip this with a slow treadmill so that you walk while you work.  (Talk about pacing the office.)  Make sure that your television can only operate if you are pedaling furiously on an exercise bike. Or, watch television in a rocking chair: rocking also takes energy and involves a continuous gentle flexing of the calf muscles.  Get rid of your office chair and replace it with a therapy ball: this too uses more muscles, and hence more energy, than a normal chair, because you have to support your back and work to keep balanced.  You also have the option of bouncing, if you like.Or you could take all this as a license to fidget.But whatever you choose, know this.  The data are clear: beware your chair.', 'F']

['\ufeffThe father of one of Emilie’s friends stopped by last Sunday morning to pick up his daughter from a sleepover.His phone rang. He spoke for a moment, then hung up, looking peeved. His wife was mad at him, he said.“What did you do?” I asked. “Nothing!” He threw up his hands. “I offered her pancakes!”“You must have done something else,” I said, settling eagerly into a chair. There is nothing more enjoyable than listening in on other people’s marital squabbles.“Ah,” I said, sympathetically.I am on a diet, too. Every time I move the scale from the tiled bathroom floor to the rug in the hallway, I lose two pounds. The same two.“At our age, it’s really hard to lose weight,” I said, peace-makingly. This was a very radical idea.I mulled it over all week. I realized that this very same not-so-great expectations theme had also come up, not long before, in a conversation I’d had with my father-in-law.\n  \n We were talking about sleep. I was ruing the fact that I need it – nine hours’ worth sometimes.I was telling him about a woman I know who gets up at 3:30 a.m. every day to do yoga. She’s on her computer at 4:30 and on a train to work at 7:30.At 7:30 I am usually spilling my first cup of coffee down the front of my bathrobe and screaming at my children that if they don’t get out of bed they’ll never again eat anything sweet or watch any TV or have anything they want in the world for the rest of their lives.“I wish I could get up early,” I said, explaining all the gracious, relaxed, self-improved Simply Being I would do, if I had an extra hour or two in the day.I was saying I wished I needed to sleep only six hours a night. Or five, or four – like the really successful people you read about. I would wake up my children, showered, teeth-brushed and smiling, the way the magazines tell you to do. I would exercise and garden and pay bills and reorganize the kitchen cabinets and make photo albums and … My father-in-law looked at me with genuine befuddlement.What a question! What a mind-bend! What a culture-clashing, anachronistic, out-of-this-world concept this had seemed: Know your limits. Acknowledge them. Deal with them. It had struck me as a revelation.But upon reflection, I’ve come to think that perhaps this is what it’s all about. “It,” of course, being this experience of life-on-the-cusp-of-middle-age to which I keep returning, rather obsessively, week after week.If one were to be highbrow about it, one could see the desire for self-surpassing – the refusal to accept, for example, a muffin top, or a greater need for sleep – as a refusal to accept mortality, which is of course the ultimate self-limit.  I never had any sense of my own mortality until I was pregnant with Emilie, my younger child, now nine. It was just a twinge then. But it accelerated when Emilie started school, and suddenly – as my waist thickened and hair thinned – it dawned on me that someday all too soon both my kids would be gone from home for good. (“What is it like to have older kids?” a mom of toddlers I’d just met asked me outside a moon bounce, at a birthday party recently.“You realize that your time with them is limited. That soon it’s all coming to an end,” I answered.A moment later, as I stood there suddenly alone, I wondered why people always seem to run away from me at parties.) Every night, for as long as I can remember now, I’ve been swearing I’ll wake up early the next day. Now, though, I am thinking of giving myself a reprieve.For on another Sunday recently I had yet another important conversation, this time with the mother of one of my best friends. She was telling me about how her mother had kept all kinds of family memorabilia. It was wonderful, she said, to have bits of personal history going back for generations.\t“I’ve been meaning for so long to make photo albums,” I said guiltily. “At least for five years.”\t“Oh, that’s nothing,” she said, folding her hands. “I’ve been waiting 50 years.” \tAnd then she laughed. She had her husband and children and grandchildren all around her. \t“Nobody makes photo albums,” she said.', 'F']
