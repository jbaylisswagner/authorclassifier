['\ufeffOpinionland is showing more and more interest in Ned Lamont’s Democratic primary challenge to Senator Joe Lieberman in Connecticut. Suzanne Nossel of the group blog Democracy Arsenal tries to explain why Lieberman is having so much trouble fending off Lamont: “The crux of Lieberman’s problem is his unwillingness to acknowledge the severity of what’s happened in Iraq, and to demand accountability for it. Iraq has now replaced 9/11 as America’s ‘prism of pain’ — the trauma-tinged lens through which everything else is viewed.” Nossel writes: No matter what they believe we must do next, any candidate who doesn’t come to grips fully with the folly of Iraq risks political oblivion.  While the public may be over debates on the manipulation of pre-war intelligence, they know that things went badly wrong en route to and in Iraq, and that no one has paid for these avoidable and costly errors. Given the severity of the consequences of the war, the public is right to demand a sharp focus on what went wrong, why and who bears responsibility.  Lieberman professes no interest in these questions, seeming to believe they should all be subsumed by overriding loyalty to the president amidst the threat of terror.  The public may have believed that for a year or two after the 9/11 attacks, but their trust has been exploited too many times by the White House, and they simply no longer do.\n …\n At this stage in the game, nearly anyone thoughtful and honest admits to real qualms about what makes sense in Iraq.  Under these conditions, forceful and unequivocal game plans are not just elusive, but probably dangerous. The public recognizes this, which is why there was no political price for the June Congressional debates that showed the Democrats divided over what to do next. In his Los Angeles Times column, Jonathan Chait calls the Lieberman-Lamont race “a full-scale Democratic civil war,” and he thinks the Nedroots are making a tactical error by attempting to oust Lieberman: “Although I’m no Karl Rove, it seems to me that turning a rock-solid Democratic seat into a potential Republican pickup represents something less than a political masterstroke.”  Washington Post columnist Ruth Marcus says Lamont’s backers would be better served by supporting Democratic challengers to Republican incumbents in the House, especially in Connecticut. She writes:  While Lamont and the bloggers who back him devote their energy to defeating Lieberman, Connecticut has three competitive House races where Democratic challengers have a chance of beating Republican incumbents and helping take back the House. Wouldn’t those be a more productive way for Democrats unhappy about Bush and the war to channel their anger? Marcus thinks the campaign to defeat Lieberman is “disturbing”: “His bipartisan instincts should be commended, not pilloried. His refusal to back away from his convictions on Iraq deserves admiration even from those who disagree.”Wait a minute, writes Matthew Yglesias at Tapped, The American Prospect blog: “The war is, if I may say so, a big deal and Lieberman’s views on it are ridiculous.” Yglesias can’t figure out why Lamont’s supporters deny that they’re motivated by anger over Lieberman’s blind support for President Bush’s policies in Iraq. “The implication that the real issue here is that Lieberman once sort-of kissed Bush seems equal parts silly and inexplicable,” he writes. “Why can’t the campaign be about the war?”', 'M']

['\ufeffWhile insiders play guessing games over the Obama cabinet, some Democratic bloggers are taking the gloves off over his transition team. Big Tent Democrat at TalkLeft is displeased that John Brennan, a counterintelligence expert who has defended giving telecommunications companies immunity for any illegal activities they undertook for the Bush administration’s surveillance efforts, is a close adviser to the president-elect.  He’s more displeased that, in his opinion, many Obama supporters have criticized him for simply questioning Barack Obama. Some of you may be pleased as punch that John Brennan is leading the transition on intelligence matters and is a leading candidate for Director of Intelligence in an Obama Administration. I am not pleased. I think the reasons should be clear to anyone who actually cares about civil liberties.Other people are concerned about the possibility that Larry Summers might be the Treasury Secretary. I do not share their concerns but I respect their willingness to speak out on their views on the matter.Other are adamant that Joe Lieberman be stripped of the committee chairmanship. I would make him promise to never join a Republican filibuster in exchange for keeping his chairmanship. Others are upset that Obama has stated he wants Lieberman to stay in the Dem Caucus. I do not share that upset. But I respect and admire those who are not afraid to speak their mind on the issue.What I can not understand is the ridiculous Cult of Obama who believes that not a negative or questioning word should be said about Obama ever. Oh sure, they’ll say “wait till he is President.” But then they’ll say “wait till he finishes his first year.” And after that, “wait for the mid terms.” And then “wait until after reelection.” In short, members of a cult can never have the leader of the cult criticized. That is how the Republicans have done it, and no one is as zealous as a convert.That last line, it would seem, is directed at John Cole of Balloon Juice, a former Republican turned lefty blogger (reader be warned before you click the link: Mr. Cole’s language can be a bit, well, earthy.) With Democrats like this, who needs Red State? If there was anyone who was more tedious during this last election cycle than Armando, aka Big Tent Democrat, let me know. Besides turning one of my favorite sites, TalkLeft, into a pseudo-Puma cess-pool during the primaries (But he supports Obama, dont’cha know- speaking for him only!), BTD’s bigger sin was dispensing bad advice to the Obama campaign on an almost daily basis. If concern trolling was an art form, BTD would be Michelangelo and the 2008 Democratic primary his Sistine Chapel …No one knows what is going on, no decisions have been made. The press is in a vacuum, publishing rumor and innuendo, and you have no clue what Obama’s opinion on torture, Gitmo, or anything else is beyond what he has publicly stated repeatedly and campaigned upon …  I know you are still fondly dreaming of a Hillary 2012 challenge, but could you base the need for this on something other than speculation in the WSJ a mere week after the election (and two months before he is inaugurated)? Was the Corner busy? You couldn’t get any inside scoop from Michael Goldfarb at the Weekly Standard?The conservative Blogger Susan Duclos at Wake Up America has sympathy for he of the big tent:Anyone that has provided links to Barack Obama’s questionable ties, his contradictory pledges that do not match his actions or previous votes, his connections to criminals and terrorists, his stated philosophies or any other information that is documented that shows him to be hypocritical or not telling the public the truth, inevitably finds themselves inundated with comments from the “Obama Cult.”One would expect this to be a Right/Left issue [but] … the “Obama Cult” will go all out to attack moderate Democrats, moderate liberals, that dare speak anything but the gospel about Obama. I have been going through a few liberal blogs to see whether the left is finally happy. After all, their candidate won the election, it should be a time to celebrate for them. They should be smiling, enjoying the win, right? Some are, but those folks cannot just enjoy, they now have gone on the attack against anyone in their own party that dares to criticize Obama …So, all this does have a point, and that is: Obamabots aka Obama Cult members do not just run around from conservative blogs or forums to spew talking points, to defend, justify, distract or excuse Obama’s flaws, faults, lies, ties or associations…… they do it to everyone, they just cannot seem to help themselves from defending their Cult leader.While the Opinionator isn’t sure that this “cult” accusation is going to stick, he can’t help being entertained when the victors fight over the spoils.', 'M']

['\ufeffTime magazine political columnist Joe Klein thinks the full-page MoveOn.org advertisement, which referred to “General Betray Us,” in Monday’s New York Times was “morally and politically outrageous.”“MoveOn has handed the Bush Administration a major victory — at a moment when all attention should be focused on whether we should continue to commit U.S. troops to this disaster,” Klein writes at Swampland, the Time political blog. “Just nauseating.” (Gen. Petraeus hadn’t yet told Senator John Warner, Republican of Virginia, that he wasn’t sure whether the Iraq war was making America safer when Klein wrote his blog post.) Klein thinks the flap over the advertisement will be more than a one-day story. He writes: Usually the Republicans are the ones who’ve tried to change topics at a crucial Iraq moment…but MoveOn usurped that gambit this time. This is going to put the Democrats on the defensive. They’re going to have to answer questions like the one posed by the odious Ileana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida: Will you disassociate yourselves from this? The Presidential candidates will be asked…and they will have to either disassociate themselves from MoveOn (which the party’s base won’t like) or associate themselves with calling General Petraeus a traitor. And make no mistake: One who betrays us is a traitor.', 'M']

['\ufeffGeorge Will, writing in his column for The Washington Post, says that during the financial crisis John McCain “is behaving like a flustered rookie playing in a league too high.” Will later adds:  Conservatives who insist that electing McCain is crucial usually start, and increasingly end, by saying he would make excellent judicial selections. But the more one sees of his impulsive, intensely personal reactions to people and events, the less confidence one has that he would select judges by calm reflection and clear principles, having neither patience nor aptitude for either.  It is arguable that, because of his inexperience, Obama is not ready for the presidency. It is arguable that McCain, because of his boiling moralism and bottomless reservoir of certitudes, is not suited to the presidency. Unreadiness can be corrected, although perhaps at great cost, by experience. Can a dismaying temperament be fixed?The Politico’s Ben Smith listens to a McCain campaign conference call and concludes that the call was “rife with simple, often inexplicable misstatements of fact” and that it may “deepen the perception, dangerous to McCain, that he and his aides have little regard for factual accuracy.” The Atlantic’s Marc Ambinder takes offense on behalf of Smith when a McCain aide says The Politico blogger is “in the tank” for Barack Obama. Ambinder writes: A reporter asks the McCain campaign to back up some basic claims made by a senior strategist in a public conference call.The campaign refuses, with a prominent spokesperson accusing the reporter, Ben Smith, of being “in the tank.” As in — no, we don’t have to justify what we say, and the fact that you would question our assertions is proof-positive that you’ve absorbed the Obama campaign’s worldview. Not only is that Addington-esque in its logic — the spokesperson is PAID by one tank, so how can he possibly make that accusation credibly — it’s also immature (like throwing reporters off planes) and counterproductive. Maybe I’m in Ben Smith’s tank for saying this.', 'M']

['\ufeffSome instant reactions from blogland to the third and final presidential debate, destined to be remembered as the “Joe the Plumber” debate:• Slate’s Mickey Kaus didn’t like the moderator: “Bob Schieffer is making John McCain look young and vigorous.” • The Atlantic’s Marc Ambinder thinks otherwise: “Bob Schieffer. The best moderator. This was the best debate. You really got a good sense of where the candidates stood.”• The American Spectator’s Quin Hillyer thinks his guy won: “McCain started a comeback tonight, and gave him a chance to claw himself back into the match before reaching the finish line. Obama, meanwhile, lost a little bit of his air of invincibility. Short version: McCain won.” • But National Review’s Ramesh Ponnuru isn’t so sure. He writes at The Corner: “A couple folks here have been saying that McCain is doing better than in the previous two debates. I wish it were true, but I just don’t see it. I think a few times McCain has come across as spluttering.” • In another post at The Corner, Ponnuru adds that every minute the candidates “spend on who’s being meaner or more dishonest in this campaign is a minute that helps Obama–not because he wins the issue, still less because he deserves to win it, but because it is not what is driving people’s votes–and they’ve spent way more than a minute on this stuff.” • Ambinder agrees that that section of the debate was bad for McCain: “The partisans want their candidates to say things that will make the self-same partisans feel good. So when McCain gets angry, lots of Republicans say: “Right on ya! ” as if persuadable voters are looking at the world through McCain’s eyes and harboring the same grudges and feeling offended by the same. I think these 20 minutes were McCain’s weakest of the three debates, at a time when he could least afford it.” • Taegan Goddard says McCain did well, just not well enough: “This was Sen. John McCain’s best debate yet. He scored many points and effectively distanced himself from President Bush with the comment, ‘I am not president Bush. If you want to run against president Bush, you should have done that four years ago.’ It was probably the only memorable soundbite from any of the debates. However, Sen. Barack Obama ultimately won the debate by repeatedly bringing it back to the issues.” Goddard later adds, “McCain also lost this debate stylistically. The split screen showed him impatient, angry, rolling his eyes and making some very odd faces. This type of body language caused Al Gore to lose the second presidential debate in 2000. I suspect it will go over poorly with viewers as well.”', 'M']

['\ufeffAre you anti-Israel? If you fear that, deep down, you might be, I have important news. The recent tension between Israel and the United States led various commentators to identify hallmarks of anti-Israelism, and these may be of diagnostic value.By never criticizing Israel, we’ll all be “pro-Israel.” And that’s a good thing, right?In short, accepting Gary Bauer’s idea of what it means to be anti-Israel seems to involve being anti-truth. So I don’t accept it. (And if you’re tempted to accept the common claim that Israel is building only in “traditionally Jewish” parts of East Jerusalem, a good antidote is this piece by Lara Friedman and Daniel Seidemann, published on Foreign Policy Magazine’s excellent new Middle East Channel.)Identifying threats to American troops is part of a general’s job, and it seems to me Petraeus could honestly conclude — without help from dark “anti-Israel” impulses — that some of those threats are heightened by the Israel-Palestine conflict and America’s relationship to it. But Max Boot, writing on Commentary’s Web site, seems to disagree; if Petraeus indeed holds such opinions, that’s a sign of “anti-Israel sentiment,” in Boot’s view.Boot assures us that this passage, far from being a good guide to Petraeus’s thinking, was just  “pulled from the 56-page Central Command ‘Posture Statement’ filed by his staff with the Senate Armed Services Committee.” Well, I don’t know who did the filing, but the document itself is titled “Statement of General David H. Petraeus … Before the Senate Armed Services Committee.” So I’m guessing it’s a fair guide to his views — in which case, by Boot’s lights, Petraeus is anti-Israel, right? And in which case I’ll reject Boot’s criterion for anti-Israelism.Boot has an ally in Abraham Foxman, the national director of the Anti-Defamation League. Foxman said  the perspective attributed to Biden and Petraeus “smacks of blaming Jews for everything.”America’s perceived support of Israel’s more inflammatory policies endangers American troops abroad and civilians at home.Foxman’s claim may seem hyperbolic, but look at it this way: If he can convince us that blaming any Israeli policy for anything is akin to blaming Jews in general for everything, then anyone who criticizes an Israeli policy will be deemed anti-Semitic — and fear of that label will keep everyone from criticizing Israel. And by virtue of never criticizing Israel, we’ll all be “pro-Israel.” And that’s a good thing, right?Actually, it seems to me that if we were all “pro-Israel” in this sense, that would be bad for Israel.As more and more people are realizing, the only long-run alternatives to a two-state solution are: a) a one-state solution in which an Arab majority spells the end of Israel’s Jewish identity; b) Israel’s remaining a Jewish state by denying the vote to Palestinians who live in the occupied territories, a condition that would be increasingly reminiscent of apartheid; c) the apocalypse. Or, as Hillary Clinton put it in addressing the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  conference on Monday: “A two-state solution is the only viable path for Israel to remain both a democracy and a Jewish state.”So, by my lights, being “pro-Israel” in the sense embraced by Bauer, Boot and Foxman — backing Israel’s current policies, including its settlement policies — is actually anti-Israel. It’s also anti-America (in the sense of ‘bad for American security’), because Biden and Petraeus are right: America’s perceived support of — or at least acquiescence in — Israel’s more inflammatory policies endangers American troops abroad. In the long run, it will also endanger American civilians at home, funneling more terrorism in their direction.The flip side of this coin is that policies that would be truly good for Israel (e.g., no more settlements) would be good for America. In that sense, there’s good news for Bauer and Boot and Foxman: one of their common refrains — that Israel’s and America’s interests are essentially aligned — is true, if for reasons they don’t appreciate.Sadly, the Bauer-Boot-Foxman definition of “pro-Israel” — supporting Israel’s increasingly hard-line and self-destructive policies — is the official definition. All major American newspapers, so far as I can see, use the term this way. AIPAC is described as “pro-Israel,” but the left-of-AIPAC J Street isn’t, even though its members, like AIPAC’s, favor policies they consider good for Israel.No doubt this twisted use of “pro-Israel,” and the implied definition of “anti-Israel,” keeps many critics of Israeli policies from speaking out — Jewish critics for fear of seeming disloyal, and non-Jewish critics for fear of seeming anti-Semitic.So, if I’m right, and more speaking out — more criticism of Israel’s current policies — would actually be good for Israel, then the newspapers and other media outlets that sustain the prevailing usage of “pro-Israel” are, in fact, anti-Israel. I won’t mention any names.', 'M']

['\ufeffThe Senate has voted 72 to 25 “to express the sense of the Senate that General David H. Petraeus, Commanding General, Multi-National Force-Iraq, deserves the full support of the Senate and strongly condemn personal attacks on the honor and integrity of General Petraeus.” That language, of course, is longhand for slapping the liberal group MoveOn across the knuckles for its “General Betray Us” ad that ran in The Times last week. So, with the vote over, the politics can start. The Times’s Caucus Blog reports that “The ad was ‘disgusting,’ President Bush said in response to a question during a news conference. ‘I felt like the ad was an attack, not only on General Petraeus but on the U.S. military.’”“A couple of the more interesting votes: Jim Webb, who just yesterday was a Netroots hero, voted for it, even though the last thing he needs as a military guy is cover on something like this,” notes Greg Sargent at TPM Election Central. “Meanwhile, Hillary — who’s been under assault by Rudy for refusing to condemn MoveOn but who’s also locked in a tough Dem primary — stood her ground and voted No.” Even more interesting to Sargent:“Barack Obama missed the politically dicey vote today on whether to condemn MoveOn for its ad blasting General Petraeus, according to the vote’s roll call. At the same time, however, Obama was indeed present for the vote this morning that came just moments before the MoveOn one. He voted for the Boxer measure condemning the attack on Petraeus and all other members of the military.”“Looks like it was initially going to be a close vote but as it became clear that it would pass, some weak-kneed Democrats flipped to opposing it,” laments Todd Beeton at MyDD.  “Makes you wonder who exactly is running the show here.”Michael Goldfarb at WorldwideStandard has a guess: “The extent to which these bloggers believe they ‘own’ the Democratic party is striking–and I’m not sure they’re entirely wrong, either.”', 'M']

['\ufeffSigns that Charles Krauthammer was souring on the Iraq war began to appear in the spring, when Krauthammer wrote in his Washington Post column that there is only “one hope for success in Iraq”: “an effective, broad-based national unity government that, during its mandatory four-year term, presides over an American withdrawal.” Now, the manner in which Saddam Hussein was executed has led Krauthammer to conclude that the current Iraq government is not worth defending. “We should not be surging American troops in defense of such a government,” he argues in The Washington Post. Krauthammer writes:   It is quite a distinction to be the preeminent monster on the planet. If the death penalty was ever deserved, no one was more richly deserving than Saddam Hussein.For the Iraqi government to have botched both his trial and execution, therefore, and turned monster into victim, is not just a tragedy but a crime – against the new Iraq that Americans are dying for and against justice itself. Saddam’s execution “turned what was an act of national justice into a scene of sectarian vengeance,” Krauthammer continues. He adds: The world saw Hussein falling through the trapdoor, executed not in the name of a new and democratic Iraq but in the name of Moqtada al-Sadr, whose death squads have learned much from Hussein.The whole sorry affair illustrates not just incompetence but also the ingrained intolerance and sectarianism of the Maliki government. It stands for Shiite unity and Shiite dominance above all else.', 'M']
